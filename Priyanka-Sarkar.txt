The top, right, bottom, and left 		properties specify offsets from the edges of the element's containing block. If the element has margins, they are added to the offset. 	The element establishes a new block formatting context for its contents.

    5. In your own words, explain the box model. What is the fix for the box model?
    Ans.All HTML elements can be considered as boxes. In CSS, the term "box model" is used when talking about design and layout.
	The CSS box model is essentially a box that wraps around every HTML element. It consists of: margins, borders, padding, and the actual 	content.
	Explanation of the different parts:
	Content - The content of the box, where text and images appear
	Padding - Clears an area around the content. The padding is transparent
	Border - A border that goes around the padding and content
	Margin - Clears an area outside the border. The margin is transparent
	The box model allows us to add a border around elements, and to define space between elements.
